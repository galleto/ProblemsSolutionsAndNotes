# Here is the problem [UVA-1124](https://vjudge.net/problem/UVA-1124) #

The problem is straightforward: we need to read the input and print it exactly as it is. There are no modifications, no calculations, and no transformations needed.

At first, the problem might seem tricky, making you think some processing is required, but in reality, it is just a simple input-output task.

# To solve this problem efficiently #

* Use getline(cin, line) to read the entire input line, ensuring spaces are preserved.

* Directly print the input using cout, followed by a newline (\n) to maintain formatting.
